# Chemistry-Metrics-Database
The chemistry production process database is being developed to capture some of the variability in testing such as batch size, instruments used, cost per test etc. to get a more accurate picture of the chemistry department’s performance. We are calling this the Chemistry Metrics Database which will allow management to make decisions based on the performance of the department.
